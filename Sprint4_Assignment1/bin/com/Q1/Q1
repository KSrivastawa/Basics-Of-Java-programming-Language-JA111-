Q1) Explain about the Marker interface?

Ans:
	An interface that does not contain methods, fields, and constants is known as
	marker interface. In other words, an empty interface is known as marker interface
	or tag interface. It delivers the run-time type information about an object.

	- It delivers the run-time type information about an object. It is the
	  reason that the JVM and compiler have additional information about an object. 
	- The 'Serializeable' and 'Cloneable' interfaces are the example of marker interface.
	 In short, it indicates a signal or command to the JVM.

	for example: 
		public interface Serializable   
		{  
			  
		}
